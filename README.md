# Artists and Repertoire Prediction Models

This repository contains a collection of materials describing the artist success prediction models I created while working at Chartmetric (Summer '19).


## A Brief, High-Level Overview

The rise and success of digital streaming has made releasing music far easier and more accessible than ever before.  As a result, there is a huge number of new artists and new songs being released into the world every day. According to [Hypebot](https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2021/02/60000-tracks-are-uploaded-to-spotify-every-day.html), more than 60,000 new tracks are added to Spotify daily!  While this fact is amazing, it reveals the overwhelming amount of data that A&R scouts, music managers, etc have at their disposal.  

The models that my mentor and I created were designed to help those in the A&R world deal with this rapidly growing amount of artist data by providing a "short" list of artists who are predicted to cross a performance metric threshold within a given time span. In other words, the models predicted which artists would see a sizable increase in their popularity within the next week.  The models' results could then be tailored to the specific needs of the user, 
whether that be by sorting by region and musical genre or by filtering out signed artists (if you only want to view currently unsigned artists)

The predictions from these models are currently sold as a part of the premium membership plan at Chartmetric and are updated everyday!
